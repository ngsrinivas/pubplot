# pubplot
A publication-quality plot generator.

Requires gnuplot and epstopdf.

To see an example of how to plot in action, look at
`pubplot-example.sh`. This script plots a file in example1
(latency vs. load). The basic set of options to plot are
available if you type `python pubplot.py` on your terminal.

More examples of both an enhanced/customized plotting python
script (pubplot.py) and shell script that puts it into
action for specific datasets (pubplot-example.sh) are
available in the example2-... and example3-... folders. You
can see sample outputs inside those folders too.
